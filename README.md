# **Yahoo Finance ESG US Funds Analytics**

This project analyzes **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)** scores of US mutual funds using Yahoo Finance data. The objective is to identify **top-performing funds based on ESG metrics** and provide category-wise insights through Python-based analytics and a Power BI dashboard.


## **Problem Statement**

Investors are increasingly looking for funds that align with **sustainable and responsible investing (SRI)** principles.  
This project aims to address:

- Which funds have the **highest ESG performance**?  
- How do **different fund categories** compare on ESG dimensions?  
- What patterns emerge in **environment, social, and governance** scores?  


## **Dataset**

The dataset comes from **Yahoo Finance US Mutual Funds** and includes:

- Fund details such as symbol, name, and category  
- ESG scores: _environment_, _social_, _governance_  
- Peer averages and category information  

**Rows:** 19,000+  
**Columns:** 298 (subset used for analysis)  


## **Key Insights**

- Top 10 US funds by overall ESG score were identified, with **RSNRX** and **RSNYX** leading the list.  
- **Category-level analysis** revealed variations in ESG performance, with some allocations excelling in environmental scores and others in social metrics.  
- Score distributions showed skewness, highlighting clusters of funds with low governance ratings.


## **Tools Used**

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data cleaning and analysis  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for exploratory analytics  
- **Power BI** for interactive dashboard visualizations
